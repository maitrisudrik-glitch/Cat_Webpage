    <!-- ETYMOLOGY -->
    <section>
      <h3>Etymology (Origin of the Word "Cat")</h3>
      <p>
        Before cats ruled homes, hearts, and the internet, they first had to earn a <strong>name</strong>.
        The word <strong>cat</strong> comes from the Old English word <em>"catt"</em>, borrowed from Late Latin
        <em>"cattus"</em>, which appeared around the <strong>4th century</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier Latin used <em>"felis"</em>, usually referring to wild cats. As cats moved closer to human
        settlements, a new word was needed — <em>cattus</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linguists believe the word traveled from <strong>North Africa or the Middle East</strong>, regions
        where cats were first domesticated and deeply respected.

    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The cat(*Felis catus*) is a small, agile, carnivorous mammal that has lived alongside humans for thousands of years. <br>
        Revered in some cultures, adored as a companion in many others, and admired universally for its grace and independence, the domestic cat occupies a unique place in human society. <br>
        Though domesticated, cats retain much of the behavior and anatomy of their wild ancestors, making them both familiar and fascinatingly untamed.<br>

    <!-- EVOLUTION -->
    <section>
      <h3>Evolution and Domestication</h3>
      <p>
        Cats were domesticated around <strong>9,000–10,000 years ago</strong>.<br>
        Cats are believed to have been domesticated approximately **9,000–10,000 years ago**, primarily in the Near East.<br>
         Unlike many domesticated animals, cats were not selectively bred for labor. <br>
         Instead, they formed a mutually beneficial relationship with early agricultural societies by controlling rodent populations around stored grain. <br>
      
         <strong>Genetic evidence links domestic cats closely to the African wildcat (*Felis lybica*).</strong><br>
          Over time, tolerance for human presence led to companionship, and companionship led to domestication—largely on the cat’s own terms.<br>

      <h3>Behavior and Temperament</h3>
      <p>
        Cats are often described as independent, but they are also capable of forming deep social bonds.<br>
        Their behavior varies widely depending on genetics, early socialization, and environment. <br>
        Common behaviors include: <br><br>
        <strong>Grooming (for hygiene and stress regulation) </strong> <br>
        <strong>Kneading (a comforting behavior rooted in kittenhood)</strong><br>
        <strong>Purring (associated with contentment, but also self-soothing) </strong><br>
        <strong>Play-hunting (a reflection of natural predatory instincts) </strong><br>
        Cats communicate through vocalizations, body language, and scent marking.Tail position, ear orientation, and posture are key indicators of mood.<br>
      </p>
    </section>
     <section>
      <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
      <p>
        Cats are <strong>obligate carnivores</strong>, meaning their bodies are biologically adapted to a meat-based diet. Essential nutrients such as taurine, vitamin A, and arachidonic acid must be obtained from animal sources. In domestic settings, cats are typically fed commercial cat food formulated to meet these nutritional needs. Access to fresh water is essential, as cats naturally have a low thirst drive.
      </p>
     </section>

     <section>
      <h3>Reproduction and Life Cycle</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sexual maturity:</strong> Around 5–9 months</li>
        <li><strong>Gestation period:</strong> Approximately 63–65 days</li>
        <li><strong>Litter size:</strong> Usually 2–5 kittens</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        Kittens are born blind and dependent, gradually developing motor skills and senses over the first few weeks. With proper care, domestic cats commonly live **12–18 years**, and many exceed 20 years.
      </p>
     </section>
     <section>
      <h3>Breeds and Diversity</h3>
      <p>
        There are over **70 recognized cat breeds**, ranging from the slender Siamese to the long-haired Persian and the nearly hairless Sphynx. Breeds differ in coat type, size, temperament, and activity level. However, the majority of cats worldwide are mixed-breed or non-pedigreed, often referred to as domestic shorthair or longhair cats.
